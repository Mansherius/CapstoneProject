# Capstone Project 2024 - FKG
As part of my Advanced Computer Science Major, I am required to create a capstone project to showcase my skills and build something of relevance. 

## Important Details
**Capstone Advisor - Prof. Lipika Dey**

**Project Description -**
The goal is to create a web app designed for users to learn about food recipes, play with them, and create their recipes using items that they have in their fridge which may not necessarily be a recipe in and of itself.
Furthermore, the project is divided among 3 ASP Students (Advanced Studies in PGD) - Jigyanshu Rout, Abhivyakti Srivastava, and myself - along with a PhD/working student who is assisting the Professor in this venture. The tasks are divided among us students and my role is to create the developer-side application that will be used for testing, adding further features, as well as enhancing and editing the Food Knowledge Graph.

### Project Details
- The Food Knowledge Graph (FKG) is an .OWL file and requires GraphDB to access and visualise it. As such SPARQL queries are required to access and retrieve the data. As these queries are quite cumbersome, I will be attempting to make the process easier by designing and creating an app that will streamline this process.
